Therefore, we are determined to generalize it to more Chinese families. \n\nIn order to promote the students to learn the STEM courses in the greatest extent with out of the comfort zone. Each class has a maximum of 8 students and no more than 3 Chinese students per class. In fact, the most exciting part is that students can take their project achievements back to home after class and get DMA official certificates.",
