### Please use the dev branch to develop the application!!!

Submit a pull request from the dev branch to the master branch and request me or Yutao as a reviewer once you finish working on all tasks assigned to you.

## Framework

-   [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), an open-source web application framework that supports server-side rendering based on Vue.js, Node.js, Webpack and Babel.js

-   components：all Vue components
-   lang: language files
-   layouts：default.vue - Template file for all pages
-   pages：webpage files，each of which automatically configures a route for the corresponding filename

## Available Scripts:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

to install all npm packages.

After installing all packages, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

to run the application in the development mode. You can view the local site by visiting [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). This allows the webpages to live reload once you save the changes in the code.

## Development Tools and Plugins Used

We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a default code editor for development

-   Vetur: Vue tooling for VS Code
-   ESLint: Find and fix problems in JavaScript code
-   Prettier: Opinionated code formatter - Open ifu-2.code-workspace file in the project root directory. The project will automatically enable `Format on Save` functionality to format all code in the project when saving changes
-   i18n Ally: All in one i18n extension for VS Code to view the translation

## Npm Packages Used

-   Style - [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/): preprocessor scripting language
-   Translation - [Nuxt-i18n](https://nuxt-community.github.io/nuxt-i18n/)

## Deployment

-   We used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)，a platform that deploys project automatically on every PR with the Github integration, to deploy the website
    -   all commits pushed to dev branch will update [https://test.ifu-china.com/](https://test.ifu-china.com/)
    -   all commits pushed to master branch will update both [https://ifu-china.com/](https://ifu-china.com/) and [https://www.ifu-china.com/](https://www.ifu-china.com/)
    -   Because we specified to use dev branch for development，you should submit a pull request [Pull Request](https://github.com/HaoyangChen/ifu-2/pulls) from dev branch to master branch
